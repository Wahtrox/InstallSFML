How To Install SFML 2.2 on BLinux

##########################################

1] Create a folder that will contains your project.

2] Copy the 'include' and 'lib' folders into your project folder. (Reminder: 'cp -R' to copy recursivly)

3] Copy the Makefile and main.cpp files into your project folder.

4] If the Makefile doesn't work, that's probably because you don't have the good version of GLEW installed on your computer.
   Run the command 'sudo rpm -i libGLEW1_10-1.10.0-2.3.1.x86_64.rpm' in this folder. Obviously, you need to be root to perform this action.
   
   If you want to install it on an other system than BLinux, you can find all libGLEW rpms here: 'http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libGLEW.so.1.10%28%29%2864bit%29'.

5] If the Makefile worked and a weird message like this './sfml-app: error while loading shared libraries: libsfml-graphics.so.2.2.0: cannot open shared object file:
   No such file or directory' appears, you need to run the command:
   
	'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/login_x/YourFolderToSFML/lib'

   For example, in my case, I would type: 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/malik_r/SFML/test/lib/'.



If you want more information about SFML, I suggest you to go to it's official website 'www.sfml-dev.org' where you can find good tutorials on how to make applications using the SFML.

Good luck and Have fun with SFML 2.2 !
